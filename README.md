:warning: Moved to https://github.com/atomist-rugs/python-library

Generate a Python library/package skeleton by clicking the next button:

[<img src="https://images.atomist.com/button/create-project.png" width="267" alt="Set Started with Atomist"/>](https://api.atomist.com/v1/projects/generators/d6812a02-54e5-478c-b75a-214329f00a0e)

This will ask you to authorize the [Atomist](https://www.atomist.com/)
application in your GitHub organisation/account then will ask you to provide
a set of parameters to generate the library skeleton.

Once the project is generated in your GitHub organisation/account, simply
checkout the newly generated project and follow its README to get started.
